The objective of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive Hospital Management System. This system aims to streamline operations such as patient management, appointment scheduling, billing, and medical record handling. By integrating a user-friendly interface with robust backend functionality, the system provides healthcare providers with tools to enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and improve patient care. Key goals include real-time appointment management, centralized record-keeping, and seamless integration with existing hospital workflows.
